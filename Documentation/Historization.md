# Historization

Historization extends [Elucidation](./Elucidation.md) to define how to record log about an application as `Item`.

## Dependencies

This module depends on [Elucidation](./Elucidation.md).

## Architecture

`Indication` for `Log` can record

- exceptions or messages
- stack traces

to know what happened to applications.

## Implementation

Nothing because this module only defines how to record log.
